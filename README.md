# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitHub Pages.  
It automatically deploys changes to `index.html` whenever the file is updated in the `main` branch.

## How It Works

1. When `index.html` is updated and pushed to `main`, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
2. The workflow builds and deploys the file to GitHub Pages.

## Setup

1. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
2. Make changes to `index.html` and push them to `main` to trigger a deployment.
